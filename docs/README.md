### Custom Dark Theme

In the module configuration, you can select a custom theme as dark theme.

If you are using a custom theme, it is recommended to create a new dark theme based on it.
You can do so by using the [Theme Builder](https://marketplace.humhub.com/module/theme-builder/description) or by following the [theming documentation](https://docs.humhub.org/docs/theme/overview/).

**Note:** The name of the theme has to contain the word "dark".

Alternatively, you can add a `dark.css` to an existing theme next to the `theme.css` file.

Please also refer to the [Guide for Administrators](https://felixwebdesign.de/humhub/docs/dark-mode/).

## Button

By default the module adds a button to the top bar. This can be switched off in the module settings.
Additionally users can change their preference in the Account Settings menu.
