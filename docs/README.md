# Dark Mode for HumHub

This module adds a dark mode to HumHub.

It provides a default dark theme based on the community theme.

## How it works

In the module settings you can select a custom dark theme or use the default DarkHumHub theme.

When your browser is in dark mode, he is told to fetch the additional dark stylesheet that overwrites the default styles. 
This way no cookies will be used for the dark mode.

## To do
- rename classes and files
- move view file to layoutAddons
- further testing
