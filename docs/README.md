# Dark Mode for HumHub

This module adds a dark mode to HumHub.

It provides a default dark theme based on the community theme.

## How it works

When your browser is in dark mode, he is told to fetch an additional dark stylesheet that overwrites the default styles. 
This way no cookies will be used for the dark mode.

## To do

Make dark theme selectable
